# Problem Statement  
## Transparent Agricultural Supply Chain Platform

### Problem Context
Agricultural supply chains today are highly fragmented and opaque. Farmers often have limited visibility into real market prices and are forced to depend on intermediaries and middlemen. This results in:

- Unfair price discovery for farmers  
- Reduced farmer income despite high consumer prices  
- Inefficient logistics and delayed payments  
- Significant food wastage due to poor coordination between supply and demand  

The lack of transparency and trust in the system negatively impacts farmers, buyers, and end consumers.

### Design Objective
The objective is to design a transparent, end-to-end digital platform that enables:

- **Fair price discovery** by allowing farmers to set and negotiate prices  
- **Direct farmer-to-buyer interaction** through secure digital contracts  
- **Reduction of food wastage** by improving demand–supply alignment  
- **Simple and accessible usability** for low-tech and rural users  

The platform should remove unnecessary intermediaries, ensure trust through verified transactions, and create a sustainable ecosystem for agricultural trade.

### Design Focus
- Farmer-first pricing control  
- Secure and transparent contract flow  
- Clear user journeys for farmers, buyers, and consumers  
- Scalable and real-world usable system
