# User Assumptions  
## Green Groves – Agricultural Supply Chain Platform

This document outlines key assumptions made during the initial design phase. These assumptions help define user needs and guide early UX decisions in the absence of primary research.

---

## 1. Farmer Assumptions
- Farmers want **control over crop pricing** instead of accepting fixed mandi rates.
- Farmers prefer **secure and guaranteed payments** before or after delivery.
- Most farmers have **basic smartphone access** but limited technical expertise.
- Farmers value **simple workflows** with minimal steps and clear instructions.
- Trust in buyers increases when **contracts and payments are transparent**.

---

## 2. Buyer / Market Owner Assumptions
- Buyers want access to **verified farmers** to reduce risk and fraud.
- Buyers prefer **bulk purchasing** through predefined contracts.
- Buyers need **price clarity, quality assurance, and delivery tracking**.
- Buyers are willing to negotiate prices if **contracts are secure and enforceable**.

---

## 3. Consumer (Shop Users) Assumptions
- Consumers prefer **fresh, locally sourced agricultural products**.
- Simple browsing and checkout are more important than complex features.
- Trust increases when product origin and farmer details are visible.

---

## 4. Platform & System Assumptions
- Digital contracts increase trust for both farmers and buyers.
- Escrow-based payments reduce disputes and delayed payouts.
- Clear user flows reduce learning effort for low-tech users.
- A single platform serving B2B and B2C use cases is feasible if navigation is clear.

---

## 5. Design Constraints
- Interface must support **low literacy and low digital familiarity**.
- Navigation should be intuitive with minimal text dependency.
- Visual clarity is prioritized over heavy animations or complex interactions.

---

## Note
These assumptions will be validated and refined in later design stages through usability testing and stakeholder feedback.
