# 🌱 Green Groves – UI/UX Design Challenge Project

Green Groves is a transparent agricultural supply chain platform designed to empower farmers through fair pricing, secure contract farming, and direct access to buyers and consumers.

This repository documents the **UX thinking, user flows, wireframes, and early UI direction** created as part of a UI/UX design challenge.

## 🏁 Challenge Details

- **Challenge Type:** UI/UX Design Sprint  
- **Round:** Round 1 – UI + Wireframes  
- **Focus:** User flows, structure, and usability  
- **Duration:** Time-bound design challenge

## 📌 Problem Statement

Agricultural supply chains suffer from price opacity, inefficient logistics, and heavy middlemen dominance. Farmers often receive low returns, while buyers and consumers face higher costs and reduced transparency.

Green Groves aims to solve this by creating a **farmer-first, transparent, and secure digital platform** that supports contract farming and direct trade.

## 🎯 Design Objective

The goal of Green Groves is to design an end-to-end platform that enables:

- Fair and transparent price discovery  
- Direct farmer-to-buyer interaction  
- Secure digital contracts with escrow-based payments  
- Reduced food wastage through better demand–supply matching  
- Simple and accessible usability for low-tech and rural users
